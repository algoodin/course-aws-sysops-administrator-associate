# Install and configure CloudWatch Agent

Install the CloudWatch Agent: 
   sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y

Configure the CloudWatch agent: 
   sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard

Choose defaults for every option except the following
**** Say no to monitoring CollectD ****
**** Standard ****
**** Monitor /var/log/messages ****
**** No to SSM parameter store **** 

Check that config.json exists here: /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin

Generate some activity on our system by installing stress - itâ€™s in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository, so first we'll install the epel repository, then we'll install stress:

Most instructions say to do the following: sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y

However, you will likely receive 'amazon-linux-extras command not found' 

To manually pull the epel repo, do the following:

   cd ~/

   wget https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

   sudo rpm -ihv --nodeps ./epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

   The explaination is as follows: Since Amazon Linux 2022 does not directly map to a CentOS release, none of the current EPEL releases are directly usable on AL2022. The Fedora project would need to create an EPEL targeting AL2022. At this moment, we don't have any information on EPEL release by Fedora targeting AL2022. Hence, officially EPEL is not configurable in AL2022 instances.

   sudo yum install stress -y

   stress --cpu 1
